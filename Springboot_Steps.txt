After installation of Springtool suite 4

We have to start with new project as spring starter project in sts, there we can give folder name and change package name and group name(both must be with name).
for demo or normal hello world project no need to add dependencies.after that right click on project select maven and update maven project

Or
we can add spring starter project in chrome by typing spring.i.o then select intializr.In that also we can add dependencies and generate those dependencies. After that unzip those dependency and open sts and import that dependency

open sts->file->import->maven->existing maven projects->next->browse and select the check box then select next->finish

For JDBC:-
We have to add jdbc API and sql driver dependencies while creating spring starter project and we have to install SQLYOg in our laptop

For MVC:-
->add Spring web dependency in new sts project

->we have to create some folders in src like below
src->main-> create Webapp->create WEB-INF->create views->create file as .jsp(whatever we give file name that should be given in java program(HelloController.java))

->we have to add some information in application properties
src/main/resources->application.properties
server.port = 7878
server.servlet.context-path=/Myapp

##views##
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/views/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp


->after that search jasper dependency in springboot in chrome. Copy that and paste below spring-boot-starter-web in Pom.xml
 <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

After that update maven project and run as springboot then open chrome and type localhost:7878/Myapp/hello we will get output

7878- host number(we can give whatever number as our wish)

hello- will be given in hellocontroller.java

->Inorder to start and stop server automatically we have to add spring devtools dependency(without this we have to manually stop the server by clicking red colour in console)
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
</dependency>
